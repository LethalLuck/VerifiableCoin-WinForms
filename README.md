# VerifiableCoin-WinForms
Foundation for a soon to be random coin selector for crypto pump groups.Will be ported to WPF, Python and JS

This needs an immense amount of work to be completely viable, it has a 200ms deadspot that needs to be adjusted either I change my pull source to a 1 second update api or Improve it to less than 100ms(MINIMUM).
Once ported to WPF this will most likely be improved, Until then I will attempt to lower the deadzone.
