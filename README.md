# VerifiableCoin-WinForms
Foundation for a soon to be random coin selector for crypto pump groups.Will be ported to WPF, Python and JS

This needs an immense amount of work to be completely viable.
Once ported to WPF this will most likely be improved.

Soon to be added:
  ```Base64 setting export and import
  Webhook integration for server admins
  Website integration
  Background workers for various tasks(ex: price checking, 1hr price changes, UI updates, etc)
  More hashing that includes all coins, settings, time, etc. To further validate coin selections.
  More but I wont speak it into existance yet
